# Serves a single-player Battleship session to one connected client.
# Game logic is handled entirely on the server using battleship.py.
# Client sends FIRE commands, and receives game feedback.

# TODO: For Tier 1, item 1, you don't need to modify this file much. 
# The core issue is in how the client handles incoming messages.
# However, if you want to support multiple clients (i.e. progress through further Tiers), you'll need concurrency here too.
